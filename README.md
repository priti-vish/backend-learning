# Backend Learning (Node.js & Express)

This repository documents my learning journey in backend development using **Node.js** and **Express**.  
It contains small examples and practice code as I explore core backend concepts step by step.

## What this repository covers so far
- Setting up an Express server
- Basic routing with (`app.get`)
- Route parameters (`req.params`)
- Query parameters (`req.query`)
- Understanding request–response flow in Express

More topics will be added as I continue learning.

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
npm install
2. Start the server:
node server.js
3.Open your browser and visit:
http://localhost:3000
